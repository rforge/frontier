THIS IS THE CHANGELOG OF THE "frontier" PACKAGE

Please note that only the most significant changes are reported here.
A full ChangeLog is available in the log messages of the SVN repository
on R-Forge.


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99-0

* corrected and considerably improved documentation of function "fontier"

* changed order of arguments of function "frontier"

* removed arguments "crossSectionName" and "timePeriodName" from function
"frontier": in case of cross-section data, these variables (information) are
not needed, and in case of panel data, the information on the panel structure
has to be added to the data set by the function "plm.data" of the "plm" package

* argument "modelType" of function "frontier" must be "ECF" or "EEF" now

* replaced argument "funtionType" of function "frontier"
by argument "ineffDecrease"

* renamed argument "eta" of function "frontier" as "timeEffect"

* split argument "mu" of function "frontier" into "truncNorm"
and "zIntercept"

* increased default value of argument "maxit" of function "frontier" to 1000

* renamed argument "step1" of function "frontier" as "searchStep"

* renamed argument "tol2" of function "frontier" as "searchTol"

* replaced argument "indic" of function "frontier" by "searchScale"

* renamed argument "gridno" of function "frontier" as "gridSize"

* renamed argument "igrid2" of function "frontier" as "gridDouble"

* renamed argument "iprint" of function "frontier" as "printIter"

* removed arguments "qxNames" and "quadHalf" from function "frontier",
because quadratic or translog frontiers can be estimated with function
"frontierQuad" now

* added "logLik" method for objects of class "frontier"

* added function "frontierQuad" for estimating quadratic and translog frontiers

* added function "frontierTranslogRay" for estimating stochastic ray
translog frontier functions

* added the generic function "efficiencies" and corresponding methods
for default objects and objects of class "frontier"

* added "elas" method for objects of class "frontierQuad"

* function frontier() and frontierQuad() return the (matched) call now

* the matrix of efficiency estimates returned by "frontier" has row names
(cross section units) and possibly column names (time period) now
